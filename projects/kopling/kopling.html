                                <p>Kopling was developed as a final project at Apple Developer Academy. The initial concept originated from an observation of foreign interest in the "kopi keliling" business culture, highlighting its uniqueness as a social and cultural phenomenon.</p>
                                <p>Powered by Unity and developed on Mac, Kopling lets players step into the shoes of a kopling brewer. The game blends light simulation and narrative storytelling, creating a grounded yet cozy experience. Other than making drinks, players are encouraged to slow down, observe, and empathize — echoing the real warmth of alternate Jakarta’s streets and the quiet companionship between strangers.</p>
                                <p>The game invites introspection, asking players to notice the humanity behind every customer and the stories hidden behind each cup.</p>
